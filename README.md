# pandas-vet

`pandas-vet` is a plugin for `flake8` that provides opinionated linting for `pandas` code.

## Motivation

Starting with `pandas` can be daunting. The usual internet help sites are littered with different ways to do the same thing and some features that the `pandas` docs themselves discourage live on in the API. `pandas-vet` is (hopefully) a way to help make `pandas` a little more friendly for newcomers by taking some opinionated stances about `pandas` best practices. It is designed to help users reduce the `pandas` universe.

Many of the opinions stem from [Ted Petrou's](https://twitter.com/TedPetrou) excellent [Minimally Sufficient Pandas](https://medium.com/dunder-data/minimally-sufficient-pandas-a8e67f2a2428). Other ideas are drawn from `pandas` docs or elsewhere. The [Pandas in Black and White](https://deppen8.github.io/pandas-bw/) flashcards have a lot of the same opinions too.

## Installation

`pandas-vet` is a plugin for `flake8`. If you don't have `flake8` already, it will install already.
